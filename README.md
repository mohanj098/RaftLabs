### Architeture

This Application is based on MERN stack, I have made backend using Nodejs and Expressjs, Database using MongoDb, Frontend is build upon Reactjs.

### AWS
If the app was accepting 1M requests every day we could use AWS lamda.


### Limitaion
1. Names are case sensitive i.e Rocky and rocky are different.
2. Asking connection between peoples that don't exist table would give you nothing.
